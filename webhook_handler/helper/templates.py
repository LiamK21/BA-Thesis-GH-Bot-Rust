COMMENT_TEMPLATE = """Hi! ðŸ¤– The test below is automatically generated and could serve as a regression test for this PR because it:
- passes, and
- fails in the codebase before the PR.

```python
%s
```

If you find this regression test useful, feel free to insert it to your test suite.
Our automated pipeline inserted the test at the end of the `%s` file before running it.

This is part of our research at the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group of University of Zurich in collaboration with [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).
